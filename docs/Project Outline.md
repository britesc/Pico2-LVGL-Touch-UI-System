## 1. Purpose and Goals

The purpose of this Project is to design and produce a device that will allow a UK Serviceman to configure it to respond to a number of Role Dependent Scenarios.
It should be registered to the User by their ZAP Number and acessed via a User Configurable Password.
The device should be able to not only record User specific information, but be able to accept subordinate information for aggregatrion and to send information to a superior Chain of Command (CoC).

1. It needs to be minimal in size.
2. It needs to have a touch screen display for interaction.
3. It needs to be rechargeable battery operated.
4. It needs to be IP67 or higher.
5. For an unqualified User, there should be "No User Serviceable Parts", to maintain integrity of the Device.
6. The device should be designed and produced with Security of Information as a Main Driver.
